Skilled and results-oriented Software Engineer with more than 14 years of experience working in a variety of environments and technologies.

Specialized in management and optimization of high performance CI/CD platforms in cloud and K8S environments. Since 2016 focusing on the DevOps culture, I have acquired knowledge closer to the infrastructure area that has broadened my vision when designing solutions and solving problems.

Used to working full time remotely, and managing distributed and multidisciplinary teams since 2016. 

Interested in being part of a project that will bring value to the world to be proud of, with a committed team where we can learn from each other while enjoying our work.
